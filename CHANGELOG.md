## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-29

This is a landmark release representing a complete architectural migration from a single JavaScript file to a modular TypeScript project. This improves performance, stability, and extensibility for the future.

### 🚀 Features

### 📝 Changed

-   **Documentation**: The `README.md` file has been completely rewritten to be more comprehensive, with a focus on clear examples and up-to-date configuration options.

### 🗑️ Removed

-   **Built-in `styles` Object**: The `styles` configuration object has been removed in favor of `card-mod` for all styling customizations.
